# PythonGamified

## Project Idea
The program mainly uses gamification to teach Python.

## Project Innovation
1. Privately deployable servers provide advanced organizational security and privacy protection.
2. Subscription-ready servers enable fully Canadian-based data processing and storage to meet Canadian privacy laws.
3. gamified learning process, immersive interactions, real-time discussions available.
4. the project helps students get quick feedback on their code and enables interactive learning by introducing APIs for Open AI and Claude AI.
5. The project introduces personalized recommendation algorithms to provide different practice questions for students in different learning situations.
6. The project integrates back-end data analysis and management for teachers and administrators to visually analyze and manage students' learning.
7. The project provides teachers with diversified suggestions for question generation by introducing AI system APIs, which improves the efficiency of question generation.
